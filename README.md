<h1>iStegIO</h1>
iStegIO is an easy to use python script / program used to hide Text messages within PNG images.The picture or photo mainly consists of pixels (r,g,b) which in turn is represented by eight bits.Our goal is to modify the <em>"Least Significant Bit"</em>, so that it may not be much noticeable. This type of steganography is called LSB(Least Significant Bit) stagnaography.After appending the text message/data we will also insert a delimiter of fifteen ones and a zero to mark the ending. This proect has been inspired from <b>@edureka</b>. In order to make things simple, I have made this, a menu driven program rather than the conventional command line arguement program, and also added some encryption decryption mechanism to it.
